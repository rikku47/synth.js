This Topic is absolute new to me. So I learn a lot of new things.

The [WEB Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) was very confusing at the beginning for me. Now, I think, I have a solid base of understanding, how the API works in some parts. For example, that the Audio Nodes connected to each other by [phone connectors, audio jacks, patch cables... etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio))

Like a real [synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer)!

The [envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)) is just a controller for a signal, like a [gamepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamepad), which controls the signal it automatically.

In other words, the envelope is like a timetable, at which time the signal goes up and down. And yes, that is the whole magic at this stage.

Even [math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) becomes in some parts simple, because you can hear and, especially, feel it!

One important thing:

I am slow, want to understand and feel!

So it takes a while for everything.

I hope this is ok.

Have a nice day!
